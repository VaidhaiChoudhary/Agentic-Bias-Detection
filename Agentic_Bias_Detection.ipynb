            "\n",
            "**Academic Achievement:** Students who have demonstrated academic rigor, achievement, and potential should receive consideration. This includes factors like GPA, standardized test scores, Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses, and academic awards or recognitions.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Diversity and Inclusion:** Institutions should strive to create a diverse student body that reflects the broader society. This encompasses considerations like race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, socioeconomic status, first-generation college students, and LGBTQ+ identity.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Talent and Passion:** Students who demonstrate talent or passion in specific areas, such as the arts, athletics, community service, or leadership, should receive consideration. These qualities can enrich the campus community and contribute to a well-rounded student body.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Personal Characteristics:** Traits like resilience, grit, and overcoming adversity should be taken into account. Students often bring unique perspectives and strengths that can benefit the institution.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Holistic Review:** Admissions committees should consider the entirety of a student's application, essays, letters of recommendation, and interviews (when applicable). A holistic review helps to understand a student's strengths, weaknesses, and potential for success.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Legacy Status:** While legacy status may be a consideration in some cases, it should not be the primary determining factor. Institutions should prioritize diversity and merit-based admissions.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Geographic Diversity:** Colleges should aim to create a student body with representation from various regions, states, or countries. This helps to promote cultural exchange, diversity of perspectives, and a more comprehensive educational experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, a balanced approach to college admissions should consider a range of factors, including academic achievement, diversity, talent, personal characteristics, and holistic review. No single factor should receive excessive preference, as this can lead to an imbalanced student body. By considering multiple perspectives, they can build a vibrant, diverse, and talented community of scholars.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bias Critic's Verdict:\n",
            " After analyzing the statement, I did not detect any significant regional bias. Here's why:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Geographic diversity is mentioned**: The statement explicitly mentions the importance of creating a student body with representation from various regions, states, or countries. This suggests that geographic diversity is valued, and institutions should strive to have a diverse student body in terms of regional representation.\n",
            "2. **No regional prioritization**: The statement does not prioritize one region over another. There is no mention of specific regions, states, or countries being more desirable or favored over others.\n",
            "3. **Balanced approach**: The overall tone of the statement is focused on promoting a holistic, balanced approach that considers multiple factors, including academic achievement, diversity, talent, personal characteristics, and geographic diversity. This indicates that no single factor, including geographic region, should receive preferential treatment.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, I do want to highlight some potential areas for improvement:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Clarify \"various regions, states, or countries\"**: The statement could benefit from a clearer definition of what constitutes\" various regions, states, or countries.\" This might help to ensure that institutions prioritize diversity in a more systematic and equitable manner.\n",
            "2. **Ensure consistent application**: To avoid unintentional bias, it's essential to ensure that their admission processes consistently apply the stated principles, including geographic diversity, to all applicants.\n",
            "\n",
